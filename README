ShapeDown is a recreation of Daniel Hooper's "ShapeUp" (https://github.com/danielchasehooper/ShapeUp-public)

ShapeUp-public is pretty messy with its one file, global scope stuff, type of structure. Not that thats bad or anything, just would like to have something more natural (this project).

nobuild (https://github.com/tsoding/nobuild) is used as the build system with GO REBUILD URSELF technology. compile once and use the executable on consecutive uses (read nobuild repo readme for more info)
